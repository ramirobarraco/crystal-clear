\chapter{Abstract}

Crystal is a general purpose object oriented programming language, designed and developed by Ary Borenszweig, Juan Wajnerman, Brian Cardiff and more than 300 collaborators.
 With a syntax inspired in Ruby, is a compiled language with static type-checking, but specifying the types of variables or method arguments is generally unneeded.
 Types are resolved by an advanced global type inference algorithm.
 Crystal is currently in active development.
 It is released as free and open-source software.
 This year Crystal launched it's 1.0.0 version and has an active community with more than 6000 shards (Crystal libraries).
 
  In this work we will try to formalize a little part of the language, in particular it's type inference.
  We will model Crystal-Clear using PLT redex and test it with a test suite of our own authorship.
  Also we will use Redex tools like Random-testing to prove language properties as security.

  Formalize this semantic may give more security and confidence to projects developed in Crystal.
